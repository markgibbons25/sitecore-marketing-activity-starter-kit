# sitecore-marketing-activity-starter-kit
This example marketing activity angular code to get you started. It is designed to be a "Send SMS" activity that has a form with two parameters - one for the return URL and one for the message text.

Another good starting point is https://github.com/steviemcg/SitecoreComms.RTBF

And of course you'll need the actual Sitecore documentation too https://doc.sitecore.com/developers/91/sitecore-experience-platform/en/add-an-activity-type-to-the-marketing-automation-ui.html
